# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# ### see the https://projecteuler.net/problem=6 ###
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 
# 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
